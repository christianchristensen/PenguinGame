# Tux Shooter

A ‘galaga’ type game where windows fall from the sky (based off an old DOS game made by my friend Tim C.), but its Tux’s (the Linux penguin) job to defend his OS by shooting the windows out of the sky before they reach the ground.

Sprites:
Penguin – with a gun (RPG) – and shooting sequence
Windows icons (to include animation)
Sky background
Bullet – with animation
